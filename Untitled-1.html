<body>Letras
    Do you ever feel like a plastic bag <br>
    Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again? <br>
    Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin <br>
    Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in? <br>
    Do you ever feel already buried deep? <br>
    <br>Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
    <br>Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
    <br>'Cause there's a spark in you
    <br>You just gotta ignite the light
    <br>And let it shine
    <br>Just own the night
    <br>Like the Fourth of July
    <br>'Cause baby, you're a firework
    <br>Come on, show 'em what you're worth
    <br>Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
    <br>As you shoot across the sky
    <br>Baby, you're a firework
    <br>Come on, let your colors burst
    <br>Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
    <br>You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
    <br>You don't have to feel like a waste of space
    <br>You're original, cannot be replaced
    <br>If you only knew what the future holds
    <br>After a hurricane comes a rainbow
    <br>Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
    <br>So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
    <br>Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
    <br>And when it's time, you'll know
    <br>You just gotta ignite the light
    <br>And let it shine
    <br>Just own the night
    <br>Like the Fourth of July
    <br>'Cause baby, you're a firework
    <br>Come on, show 'em what you're worth
    <br>Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
    <br>As you shoot across the sky
    <br>Baby, you're a firework
    <br>Come on, let your colors burst
    <br>Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
    <br>You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
    <br>Boom, boom, boom
    Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
    It's always been inside of you, you, you
    And now it's time to let it through
    'Cause baby, you're a firework
    Come on, show 'em what you're worth
    Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
    As you shoot across the sky
    Baby, you're a firework
    Come on, let your colors burst
    Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
    You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
    Boom, boom, boom
    Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
    Boom, boom, boom
    Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon</body>
